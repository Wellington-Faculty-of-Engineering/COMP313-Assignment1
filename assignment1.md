# Assignment 1

## Due 5th August - 30%

**Objective**: To learn to use Unreal as a game development environment.

Tasks:
 * Install Dev environment
   * Unreal 5.0.2 https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download (either licence)
   * Visual Studio Community 2022 https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
   * Git and Git LFS https://git-lfs.github.com/
   * Github student pack https://education.github.com/pack and Github copilot
   * Make sure you understand Git repositories - you must know how to edit a .gitignore file. Read through this https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control
   * Work through the programming introduction to Unreal. https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-cpp-quick-start/
 * Select an area to focus on from ether:
   * Implementing a simple game
   * Demonstrate a game related technology

You need to show that you have edited a game template or created from a blank project, and you can:
   * Edit the control system for a character on screen
   * Have a character interact with objects in the world
   * Edit the animation of a character based on movement
   * Change game "score" and display it on screen (this could be time or other updating variable)
   * Manage assets in the level - span at least one object
   * Control NPCs behaviour. (anything from simple door opening, to full AI behaviour)
   * Play sounds
   * Restart a level
   * Show a final screen
   * Create a settings menu with at least a slider and a toggle interaction
   * Create at least one blueprint node in C++ (at least create a C++ class that is a blueprint function class and use it in your project)
   * Make a video to show the project and your code contribution ( < 10 mins )

## Rubric
 * Set your weighting 

Game grading
 * Control systems 20% (10-30)
 * User Interface 30% (20-40)
 * Interactions 25% (15-35)
 * Documentation 15% (10 - 25)
 * Video 10% (5-15)

Technology grading
 * Control and Interaction 20% (10-30)
 * User Interface 30% (20-40)
 * Technology 25% (15-35)
 * Documentation 15% (10 - 25)
 * Video 10% (5-15)

## Submission
Your project should be either an gitlab.ecs or github repository. The repository should include:
 * Readme containing
   * Course code
 * Your name
 * Assignment number
 * Title of the technology / Game
 * Link to video (onedrive/vimeo/youtube/googledrive other video service) showing the prototype/game ( approx. 4-9 mins )
 * Either a Game Description or a Technology Description

Game Description
 * What is the main game mechanic
 * What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal
 * What is the most interesting part of the game
 * Reflection on learning

Technology Description
 * What is the support for the tech in Unreal
 * What was the hardest part of the tech to implement
 * How is the technology used in existing games
 * How could this be used in future games?
 * Reflection on learning

### Examples of Technology
There are many technologies you could choose to look at and you shouldn't be limited by this list but take it as a starting point:
 * AI:
   * Navigation meshes
   * Goal-Oriented Action Planning
   * Behaviour trees

Genetic Algorithms for game balancing
 * Rendering:
   * Shaders for particle effects
   * Realistic water
   * Raytracing
   * Virtual Reality
   * Augmented Reality
   * Lumin system
   * Procedural Content
   * Game Analytics
   * ...

### Examples of Games
Games that you could implement
 * 3D Pacman
 * Driving game
 * Match 3 - bejewelled style
 * Platformer
 * ...
